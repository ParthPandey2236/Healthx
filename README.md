 # Note :- 
 1) All illustrations needs to be first passed by the team and then added
 2) Main colour of the app is green (all shades cool) as medical - green stereotype
 3) probabilty calculator needs to discussed upon as to how we planning to do those as there can be a number of ways in doing so and I cannot estimate the load of the work.
 4) This is a very vague and rough division but we will discuss the flow of the app.
